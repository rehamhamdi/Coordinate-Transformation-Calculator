# Coordinate-Transformation-Calculator
This tool is useful for students, engineers, and scientists who frequently work with different coordinate systems and vector mathematics. It simplifies the process of converting coordinates and performing vector operations, making it a practical utility for mathematical and engineering computations.
#Key Features:
1-Coordinate Transformations:
Cartesian to Cylindrical: Converts Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z).
Cylindrical to Cartesian: Converts cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z).
Cartesian to Spherical: Converts Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) to spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ).
Spherical to Cartesian: Converts spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z).
Spherical to Cylindrical: Converts spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z).
Cylindrical to Spherical: Converts cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) to spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ).

2-Vector Operations:
Cross Product: Calculates the cross product of two vectors.
Dot Product: Calculates the dot product of two vectors.
